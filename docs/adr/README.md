# Architecture Decision Records

One record per decision that is important or expensive to reverse. Every ADR has: Context · Decision ·
Alternatives rejected · Consequences · Reversibility · Security implications.

`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` holds the stack-level ADR-01…ADR-12 (language, framework, database, ORM, hosting…).
This folder holds the **domain and safety** decisions that outlive any technology choice.
